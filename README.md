### Project Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook of a Simple Linear Regression performed on the "powerpoduction" data set of "wind speed" vs "power output". Further to this analysis a Polynomial Regression was explored and finally a Logistic Regression to compare suitability of each solution. The exploration and further findings were based on further research conducted on the subject matter. The overall goal was to plot a suitable line of best fit to replicate the power curve of the wind turbine measured in the data set.

### How to run the Notebook
#### Installation
It is recommended to install the Anaconda distribution which includes Python, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook and other commonly used libraries for data analysis and scientific computing. It can be installed by downloading the graphic installer from the Anaconda website, depending on your operating system.

#### Running the Jupyter Notebook
Clone the repository to your local machine and launch Jupyter Notebook by typing "Jupyter Notebook" in the command line from the same repository to start using the notebook. The Notebook is entitled "Project.ipynb"
